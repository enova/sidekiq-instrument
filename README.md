# Sidekiq::Instrument
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/enova/sidekiq-instrument.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/enova/sidekiq-instrument)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/enova/sidekiq-instrument/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/enova/sidekiq-instrument?branch=master)

Reports job metrics using Shopify's [statsd-instrument][statsd-instrument] library, incrementing a counter for each enqueue and dequeue per job type, and timing the full runtime of your perform method.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sidekiq-instrument'
```
ddd
And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sidekiq-instrument

## Usage

For now, this library assumes you have already initialized `StatsD` on your own;
the `statsd-instrument` gem may have chosen reasonable defaults for you already. If not,
a typical Rails app would just use an initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/statsd.rb
require 'statsd-instrument'
StatsD.prefix  = 'my-app'
StatsD.backend = StatsD::Instrument::Backends::UDPBackend.new('some-server:8125')
```

Then add the client and server middlewares in your Sidekiq initializer:

```ruby
require 'sidekiq/instrument'

Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
  config.server_middleware do |chain|
    chain.add Sidekiq::Instrument::ServerMiddleware
  end

  config.client_middleware do |chain|
    chain.add Sidekiq::Instrument::ClientMiddleware
  end
end

Sidekiq.configure_client do |config|
  config.client_middleware do |chain|
    chain.add Sidekiq::Instrument::ClientMiddleware
  end
end
```

## StatsD Keys
For each job, the following metrics will be reported:

1. **shared.sidekiq._queue_._job_.enqueue**: counter incremented each time a
   job is pushed onto the queue.
2. **shared.sidekiq._queue_._job_.dequeue**: counter incremented just before
   worker begins performing a job.
3. **shared.sidekiq._queue_._job_.runtime**: timer of the total time spent
   in `perform`, in milliseconds.
3. **shared.sidekiq._queue_._job_.error**: counter incremented each time a
   job fails.

The metric names can be changed by overriding the `statsd_metric_name`
method in your worker classes.

For each queue, the following metrics will be reported:
1. **shared.sidekiq._queue_.size**: gauge of how many jobs are in the queue
1. **shared.sidekiq._queue_.latency**: gauge of how long the oldest job has been in the queue

## Worker
There is a worker, `Sidekiq::Instrument::Worker`, that submits gauges
for various interesting statistics; namely, the bulk of the information in `Sidekiq::Stats`
and the sizes of each individual queue. While the worker class is a fully valid Sidekiq worker,
you should inherit from it your own job implementation instead of using it directly:

```ruby
# app/jobs/sidekiq_stats_job.rb
class SidekiqStatsJob < Sidekiq::Instrument::Worker
  METRIC_NAMES = %w[
    processed
    failed
  ]

  sidekiq_options queue: :stats
end
```

In this example, we override the default stats with the ones we want reported by defining `METRIC_NAMES`.
This can be either an Array or a Hash (if you also want to map a stat to a different metric name).

You can schedule this however you see fit. A simple way is to use [sidekiq-scheduler][sidekiq-scheduler] to run it every N minutes.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
